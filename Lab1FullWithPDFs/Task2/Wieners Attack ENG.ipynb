    "# Wiener's attack\n",
    "RSA decryption (or signature) creation tends to be relatively energy and time expensive, since we can't just pick a nice private exponent $d$ with low Hamming weight (it would be easily guessable). So one may experience an urge to peek such public exponent $e$, that $d$ bitlength is much less than the modulus $N$, say if $N$ is 2048, than $d$ is around 500 bits. Intuition says, that since $d$ is hard to guess (500 bits), you should feel safe with this decision. Unfortunately, this is and extremely dangerous mistake to make. \n",
    "## Theorem (M. Wiener)\n",
    "Let $N = pq$ with $q<p<2q$. Let $d<\\frac{1}{3}N^{\\frac{1}{4}}$. Given $(N,e)$ with $ed=1\\space mod\\space \\varphi(N)$, Marvin can efficiently recover $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof (taken from [Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf) by Dan Boneh)\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is based on approximations using continued fractions. Since $ed=1\\space mod\\space \\varphi(N)$ there exists a $k$ such that $ed-k\\varphi(N)=1$. Therefore,\n",
    "$$\\lvert\\frac{e}{\\varphi(N)}-\\frac{k}{d}\\rvert=\\frac{1}{d\\varphi(N)}$$\n",
    "Hence, $\\frac{k}{d}$ is an approximation of $\\frac{e}{\\varphi(N)}$. Although Marvin does not know $\\varphi(N)$, he may use $N$ to approximate it. Indeed, since $\\varphi(N)=N-p-q+1$ and $p+q-1<3\\sqrt{N}$, we have $\\lvert N-\\varphi(N)\\rvert<3\\sqrt{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $N$ in place of $\\varphi(N)$ we obtain:\n",
    "$$\\lvert\\frac{e}{N}-\\frac{k}{d}\\rvert=\\lvert\\frac{ed-k\\varphi(N)-kN+k\\varphi(N)}{Nd}\\rvert=\\lvert\\frac{1-k(N-\\varphi(N))}{Nd}\\rvert\\le\\lvert\\frac{3k\\sqrt(N)}{Nd}\\rvert=\\frac{3k}{d\\sqrt{N}}$$\n",
    "Now, $k\\varphi(N)=ed-1 \\lt ed$. Since $e \\lt N$, we see that $k \\lt d \\lt \\frac{1}{3}N^{\\frac{1}{4}}$. Hence we obtain:\n",
    "$$\\lvert\\frac{e}{N}-\\frac{k}{d}\\rvert\\le \\frac{1}{dN^{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\lt\\frac{1}{2d^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic approximation relation. The numbber of fractions $\\frac{k}{d}$ with $d\\lt N$ approximating $\\frac{e}{N}$ so closely is bounded by $log_{2}N$ In fact, all such fractions are obtained as convergents of the continued fraction expansion of $\\frac{e}{N}$ All one has to do is compute the $log\\space N$ convergents of the continued fraction for $\\frac{e}{N}$. One of these will equal $\\frac{k}{d}$. Since $ed-k\\varphi(N)=1$, we have $gcd(k,d)=1$ and hence $\\frac{k}{d}$ is a reduced fraction. This is a linear-time algorithm for recovering the secret key $d$. **Q.E.D**"

    "$$x=[a_0;a_1,a_2,...]$$\n",
    "A continued fraction can be approximated by its initial segments. Such approximations are called *convergents*.\n",
    "Obviously, for a rational $x$ the number of such convergents is finite.\n",
    "The first four convergents of a continued fraction are:\n",
